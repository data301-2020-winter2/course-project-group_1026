## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
For this project, we've chosen the US Census dataset from 2017. With this project, we hope to further our understanding of how we can use and manipulate data to produce conclusions that better our understanding of a topic. We chose this specific dataset because it's interest can help answer many questions one might have about how a certain population is distributed. This, in turn, can help address issues within society with policy. While we don’t currently have a question we want to explore, I do believe that the data we have currently has many directions or opportunities that other data sets don’t have. For example, the many columns allow us to compare and test multiple variables to answer any questions we may have. Finally, this data can be easily represented in a “dashboard” as indicated in the Project Milestones. The different variables that can be used will be reflected in a way that can be easily interpreted. One of the limitations with this data can be the fact that it is very large. Because of it's size, it may be difficult to get through all of it; however, we are confident that we could acquire the assistance needed to present it in a way that makes sense. 



## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

For this project, we've chosen the US Census dataset from 2017. The data here are taken from the DP03, and DP05 tables of the 2017 American Community Survey 5-year estimates. The entire data set can be found at the American Factfinder website. The US Census Bureau collected this data. We have about 37 columns in the dataset, representing a lot of different variables such as transit type, race, and household income. Furthermore, there are about 74000 rows making it a large and flexible data set to work on. Since this dataset is pretty flexible, we are planning on using it for learning, as well as for checking transparency or the behaviour in the data set. This census data by the US census bureau is collected from surveys. A large number of surveys are spread throughout the country to make this dataset.
